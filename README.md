# IOT-Project-Weather-Monitoring-Autonomous-Device
Weather Monitoring Autonomous Device(WMAD) is a customizable and affordable weather monitoring system for general purpose use. This proposal outlines the plan to design and build a weather station.
# Project Description
WMAD is a weather station that can measure temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. This project combines Arduino technologies with with multiple sensors (DHT11 Sensor,BMP180 Sensor,MQ-135 Sensor)to monitor temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and air quality, delivering data to an LCD display and to a cloud server. The WMAD is designed for flexibility, making it ideal for both personal and educational applications, as well as research purposes.
